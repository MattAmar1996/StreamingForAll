StreamingForAll

The goal of this project is to develop software which will enable people with all different forms of physical and mental disabilities to interact with and use modern streaming platforms. Current streaming platforms offer little assistance to disabled individuals and our goal is to make using these platforms as simple as possible. 

The main issues are:
- Size of buttons/icons: makes selecting media hard to see and difficult to select
- Number of choices: creates confusion and obfuscates the process of streaming the content
- Menus hidden away behind other menus cause confusion and can hinder functionality

We plan to use a python based API called Guidebox which will aggregate all the different streaming services into one easy to access service. From there we will develop a simple Java front-end for the users to interact with. The main goal of the front end is to provide the least number of confusing choices as possible in order to reduce confusion and enable easy selection of choices. (Think maybe 3-4 big buttons on the screen at one time).
